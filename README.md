A Clojure representation of polynomials.

You can read through `src` and `test` directly or read it as HTML by
using [Marginalia](https://github.com/gdeer81/marginalia). You can
find the documentation in the artifacts for the latest CircleCI build,
or you can generate them yourself:

```shellsession
$ lein marg src test
```
